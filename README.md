A simple Cover Art API I wrote in PHP.

Sorry for messy code i am a noob in PHP :(

i use Deezer API to retreive the cover Art.

Just made it simple :)


```JSON
{
"results": {
"artist": "Chronic Law",
"title": "Don't Call me Nuh Gangsta",
"album": "Don't Call me Nuh Gangsta",
"artwork": "https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/623c3cd769664e7ec729e5841ff76764/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg",
"time": "03:20"
}
}
```

How to use it ? just download the php file into your server and do .... https://domain.com/search.php?query=Song-Title
